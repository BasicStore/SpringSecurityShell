SPRING SECURITY APP

Handles security within a web app from sign in to log off with OOB functionality.
Includes a bespoke login page.
No distinction between roles beyond generic authorization.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRED COMPONENTS:

- view resolver

- extend WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter to define a user and specify which actions are to be secured 

- login.html (with error and logout params for returning to this page with an error / or as signed out)
  the login form nominally forwards to itself, but the framework understands this is to be forwarded to the original action
  
- provide a means of signing out, see hello.html
  note the use of framework variable 'httpServletRequest.remoteUser' to get the user name
